        Our mission is to tell sweeping stories through the medium of music. We
        love emotional melodies and spine-tingling harmonies. We love the bold,
        dramatic backdrop of a full orchestra and choir, and we're also partial
        to intimate, delicate arrangements for strings and piano or ethnic
        instruments. We're particularly fond of a bit of cello.
